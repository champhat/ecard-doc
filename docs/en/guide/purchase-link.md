# Purchase link

Pledg gives you access to a page that allows you to generate purchase links. You can forward these links to buyers so that they can pay you with Pledg.
This page is located on your Pledg dashboard.

## Open the link generation page

Go to the [Pledg dashboard](https://dashboard.ecard.pledg.co/) then log in your account.
Be careful to select **the account corresponding to the payment method that your customer wants to use !**
