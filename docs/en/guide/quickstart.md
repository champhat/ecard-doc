# Start up

Pledg's dashboard allows you to configure your means of payment and track the payments made to your various accounts.

## Account creation - first connection

When integration is complete, you can request activation of your account at support@pledg.co, and we will give you access to your [production dashboard](https://dashboard.ecard.pledg.co/#/).
